                        <li class="answer">
                            <p>I have always been fascinated by technology and its potential to change the world. My passion for computer science was
                            ignited when I realized that it was the driving force behind many of the technological advancements that have

                            <p>Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with various leaders who've shaped my work ethic and professional
                            growth. My best experience was with Sergeant Reyes. His relentless push for excellence and professionalism was truly
                            inspirational. He fostered a culture of discipline and continuous learning, which spurred me to solve complex problems
                            and strive for better results. His influence is something that I still carry with me today in my approach to work.
                            
                            On the other hand, my most challenging experience was with Sergeant Granadon. Unfortunately, he often made inappropriate
                            comments and fostered a racially charged work environment. This experience, while difficult, taught me the importance of
                            respecting diversity and fostering an inclusive work culture. I've made it a point to carry these lessons forward and
                            promote a respectful and open work environment wherever I go.

                        <li class="answer">
                            <p>In a job, what I find most interesting is the opportunity to solve challenging problems using my skills in computer
                            science. The chance to constantly learn, grow, and innovate truly excites me. I appreciate when a role offers the space
                            to collaborate with a team of diverse professionals, as I believe that the best solutions often arise from a mix of
                            perspectives.
                            
                            On the other hand, what interests me least is monotony. I thrive in an environment that constantly presents new
                            challenges and learning opportunities. Jobs that involve repetitive tasks with little room for growth or innovation tend
                            not to capture my interest. However, I understand that every role might have some routine aspects, and I'm prepared to
                            tackle them with a positive attitude and efficiency, as they often lay the groundwork for the more complex challenges.

                        <li class="answer">
                            <p>When it comes to identifying a major weakness, I'd say it's my tendency to be overly self-critical. I set very high
                            standards for myself and can spend too much time analyzing my work to ensure it meets my expectations. This
                            characteristic, while beneficial in ensuring quality, can sometimes lead to inefficiencies as I may spend longer on
                            tasks trying to achieve what I see as perfection. However, I'm aware of this and I've been actively working on striking
                            a balance between maintaining high standards and working efficiently. I find that setting clear goals and adhering to
                            timelines helps me manage this tendency better.

                        <li class="answer">
                            <p>In my software engineering course, I found myself in a challenging situation where out of a team of eight, only three of
                            us were actively contributing. Our task was to develop a web application by the end of the quarter, a substantial
                            endeavor requiring substantial effort from all team members. Despite repeated requests for active participation and
                            equal contribution, I was often met with excuses from the rest of the team.
                            
                            Seeing no alternative, I took on multiple roles - from front-end and back-end development to a more comprehensive
                            team-leading role. This decision certainly amplified the pressure and workload but was a necessary step to ensure we met
                            our deadline.
                            
                            Despite the stress, I used this situation as a chance to deepen my understanding of all aspects of web development and
                            enhance my leadership skills. It was a strenuous time, but eventually, we successfully submitted the project on time.
                            This experience taught me the importance of resilience, clear communication, and contingency planning in teamwork. While
                            I hope not to be in such a situation again, I am better equipped to handle such challenges if they arise in the future.

                            <p>One of my key strengths is my resilience, honed by overcoming personal and professional challenges like cancer and
                            complex team dynamics. This quality enables me to tackle obstacles with a determined and optimistic mindset.

                            In addition, my time in the military has instilled in me strong leadership skills and discipline, ensuring that I always
                            bring a high level of commitment and professionalism to my work. I thrive in team settings and am skilled in
                            coordinating with diverse individuals to achieve common objectives.

                            <p>Reflecting on a moment I consider a failure, I recall an instance from early in my career in the military where I made a
                            strategic error during a training exercise due to lack of thorough planning. I was given the responsibility to lead a
                            part of the operation, and I thought I had all the necessary details sorted out. However, I underestimated the level of
                            complexity and overestimated my preparation.
                            
                            The failure happened, I believe, due to a combination of overconfidence and insufficient preparation. I had not
                            thoroughly evaluated all the potential scenarios or taken into account certain unforeseen factors. This failure served
                            as a wakeup call for me. I realized the importance of meticulous planning, comprehensive preparation, and constant
                            learning from each experience.
                            
                            This failure became a pivotal learning experience for me, shaping how I approach challenges now. It has made me more
                            humble, thorough, and appreciative of the continuous learning process. Even though it was a failure, I view it as a
                            necessary part of my personal and professional growth.

                            <p>An example of my leadership and initiative was during my Software Engineering course in university.
                            
                            Our task was to develop a fully functional web application by the end of the quarter. We were divided into teams and I
                            found myself co-leading our team. Despite being a group of eight, it became apparent early on that only three of us were
                            actively contributing to the project.
                            
                            Understanding the gravity of the situation and the potential impact on our grades, I decided to step up and take on a
                            larger role. I found myself not only leading the team but also performing a variety of roles including front-end
                            development, back-end programming, and coordinating the team.
                            
                            This experience was challenging and stressful, but I learned a lot from it. It was a crash course in effective team
                            management, clear communication, and problem-solving under pressure. I developed strategies to keep the team motivated,
                            manage workloads, and ensure we were all aligned on our goals.
                            
                            In the end, despite the hurdles, we were able to deliver a fully functional web application by the deadline. It was an
                            exhausting yet rewarding experience, a true testament to my capabilities as a leader and problem solver. This is the
                            sort of dedication and initiative I bring to all of my work.

                            <p>During my studies, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a classmate, Alex, on a graphics project. The primary goal
                            was to implement shadow mapping in a 3D environment.
                            
                            We divided the project tasks based on our skills and interests, but as we delved deeper into the implementation, we hit
                            a roadblock. We were stuck for two days trying to troubleshoot an issue with the shadow rendering. As challenging as it
                            was, I decided to buckle down and examine our code line by line, experimenting with different solutions and approaches.
                            
                            After numerous trials and errors, I was able to find a resolution to the problem and effectively implemented the
                            majority of the shadow mapping project. Alex was then able to use my contributions to finalize the project.
                            
                            In addition to this, I took the responsibility of writing the project report. This involved documenting our processes,
                            challenges, and solutions, as well as our learning outcomes. I ensured that the report was comprehensive, clearly
                            articulated, and professionally presented.
                            
                            This experience taught me the importance of perseverance, clear communication, and the power of collaborative
                            problem-solving. Even when faced with tough challenges, my commitment to the team and the project never wavered. I am
                            proud of what we accomplished together and look forward to bringing this same level of dedication and teamwork to future
                            projects.

                            Moreover, I realized the importance of outreach and the difference it can make in our communities. This understanding
                            led me to get involved in computer science outreach programs for underprivileged youth, which has been rewarding and
                            fulfilling.
                            
                            In terms of personal development, I've worked on my leadership skills, leading projects and teams during my coursework.
                            I've also focused on improving my communication and interpersonal skills, understanding their importance in any work
                            environment.
                            
                            Last but not least, beating cancer has been a life-changing experience that made me value my health more than ever. I
                            made changes to my lifestyle to stay fit, active, and healthy. It taught me about resilience and the power of a positive
                            attitude.
                            
                            Looking back, I can see a lot of growth and development. It has been a journey filled with challenges, learning, and
                            satisfaction, and I'm excited about continuing this growth trajectory in the coming years.
