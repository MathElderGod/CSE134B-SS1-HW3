        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>As a Professional:</h2>
        <p>
            Former Mortar Man Infantryman with the US Army, I leveraged my disciplined approach and resilience when I
            embarked on a new mission in academia. Beginning at community college in 2017, I challenged myself by
            quadruple
            majoring in <strong>Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and University Studies in Math and
                Science</strong>,
            resulting in four associate degrees by spring 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having been accepted into multiple prestigious institutions, <em>I chose to specialize in Computer Science
                at
                UCSD</em>. Currently, in my 4th year, I have honed my skills in everything from basic to advanced
            programming concepts,
            including data structures, algorithms, and machines. I am a proud two-time member of the Muir Caledonian
            Honor Society
            and have maintained a 3.8 overall GPA - a testament to my commitment and tenacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, I have participated in the National Name Exchange, indicating my
            potential for
            graduate studies. As I look forward to graduating in Fall 2023, I am excited about leveraging my academic
            and military
            experiences to contribute to the field of computer science. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my
            unique skill
            set and grow as a professional in the tech industry

            In essence, my journey in computer science is more than just a career path; it's a testament to my
            passion for problem-solving, innovation, and continuous learning. I believe in growing my skills and
            contributing to the
            broader tech community. When I am not coding or exploring the
            latest tech trends, you can find me playing video games, working out, or spending time with my wife
            and kids.

                I am a Latino Male born and raised in Imperial County, California. My hometowns are both Westmorland
                and Brawley since I was born in Brawley and grew up in both cities. I was born a twin with four brothers
                and one sister. My parents are immigrants from Mexico, coming from Jalisco, Guadalajara, and Dolores
                Hidalgo,
                Guanajuato.

            <p>
                I joined the military at 18 in 2013, four days after my high school graduation, and served as an
                Infantryman
                Mortarman
                in the US Army at Ft. Wainwright, AK. I have
                received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Conduct_Medal_(United_States)">Good Conduct
                    Medal</a>,

                served
                a three-year contract and separated from the military via Honorable Discharge in 2016.

                I have been married since 2015 and have two kids - a boy and a girl. Although parenting is harsh, I owe
                it
                to my wife that I have been
                able to succeed in my life despite several hardships. One of the reasons I decided to go to school and
                major
                in Computer
                Science was to give my wife a better life than we initially had. I decided to start school by going to
                Imperial Valley College
                in 2017. As a result, I have been going to school ever since.

                While attending UCSD in Spring 2021, I started losing weight significantly. I couldn't maintain a
                healthy
                diet, as I was losing my
                ability to eat. By the Summer of 2021, I was diagnosed with <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma">
                    Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
                </a>. I was going to pass away and leave my pregnant wife, at the time, and my 1-year-old son alone in
                this
                world. It hurts when I think
                about it, and no level of therapy will truly cause those wounds to heal. Miraculously, I kept advocating
                for
                myself to doctors to receive
                chemotherapy treatment.As a result, I went to Scripts Mercy Hospital in San Diego, where I started
                therapy and got much-needed
                answers. My cancer took over my entire stomach, and a mass tumor in the upper cardia was
                closing my esophagus entirely.
                As I received my first chemotherapy, I couldn't help but think <i>I am so happy to be here to get a
                    fighting chance at continuing to be here for my family!</i>

            Fortunately, I beat cancer by Spring 2022. As a result, I am an advocate for Cancer Awareness. One of my
            desires is for a cure for cancer within my lifetime. As a cancer survivor, I can admit that my empathy has
            grown
            significantly
            more. I try my hardest to fully understand
            people for who they are and what they stand for! I make sure that every day counts!

            <p id="poem">
                In code and in life, a warrior true,<br>
                Balancing bytes and battles, all the way through.<br>
                Through screens of static, and fields of strife,<br>
                A champion in the game of life.<br><br>

                A player of games in the digital realm,<br>
                At the workout's helm, his muscles overwhelm.<br>
                With wife and children by his side,<br>
                Through life's coded path, they joyfully glide.<br><br>

                Passions ignite for the unseen and unheard,<br>
                In the language of computers, he's skilled in every word.<br>
                To underprivileged youth, his wisdom he shares,<br>
                Showing that in life and code, someone deeply cares.<br><br>

                The satisfaction of programs, well-structured and clean,<br>
                A testament to a mind, sharp and keen.<br>
                A victory over cancer, a badge of honor worn,<br>
                In the face of adversity, no man is more sworn.<br><br>

                In Muir Caledonian's ranks, his name resounds,<br>
                Among the learned and the wise, his place abounds.<br>
                An expert infantryman, a veteran brave,<br>
                A legacy of courage, in his heart engraved.<br><br>

                A father, a husband, in life's grand design,<br>
                In the family of code, and the code of family, he does shine.<br>
                Through every function, loop, and array,<br>
                He's coding a better world, in his unique way.<br>
