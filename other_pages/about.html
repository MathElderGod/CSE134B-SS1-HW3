        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>As a Professionl:</h2>
        <p>
            Former Mortar Man Infantryman with the US Army, I leveraged my disciplined approach and resilience when I
            embarked on a new mission in academia. Beginning at community college in 2017, I challenged myself by
            quadruple
            majoring in <strong>Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and University Studies in Math and
                Science</strong>,
            resulting in four associate degrees by spring 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having been accepted into multiple prestigious institutions, <em>I chose to specialize in Computer Science
                at
                UCSD</em>. Currently, in my 4th year, I have honed my skills in everything from basic to advanced
            programming concepts,
            including data structures, algorithms, and machines. I am a proud two-time member of the Muir Caledonian
            Honor Society
            and have maintained a 3.8 overall GPA - a testament to my commitment and tenacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, I had the honor of being invited to participate in the National Name Exchange, indicating my
            potential for
            graduate studies. As I look forward to graduating in Fall 2023, I am excited about leveraging my academic
            and military
            experiences to contribute to the field of computer science. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my
            unique skill
            set and grow as a professional in the tech industry

            In essence, my journey in computer science is more than just a career path; it's a testament to my
            passion for problem-solving, innovation, and continuous learning. I believe in not only growing my
            skills but also contributing to the broader tech community. When I am not coding or exploring the
            latest tech trends, you can find me playing video games, working out, or spending time with my wife
            and kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me, both as a professional and as an individual.
            I am always open to new opportunities, collaborations, or just a good tech-related conversation. Please
            feel free to reach out through my contact page if you'd like to connect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's to the future and the exciting technological advancements it holds!

        <h2>As a Person:</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Latino Male who was born and raised in Imperial County, California. My hometowns are both westmorland
            and brawley, since I was born in brawley and raised in both cities. I was born a twin, and I have 4 brothers
            and 1 sister. My parents are immigrants from Mexico, coming from Jalisco, Guadalajara and Dolores Hidalgo,
            Guanajuato.

        </aside>
        <p>
            I joined the miltary at 18 in 2013, four days after my highschool gradaition, and served as an Infantryman
            Mortarman
            in the US Army at Ft. Wainwright, AK. I have
            recieved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Conduct_Medal_(United_States)">Good Conduct
                Medal</a>,

            a 3 year contract and seperated from the military via Honorable Discharge in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been married since 2015, and have two kids - a boy and a girl. Although parenting is tough, I owe it
            to my wife that I have been
            able to succeed in my life despite several hardships. One of the reason I decided to go to school and major
            in Computer
            Science was to give my wife a better life than we initially had. I decided to start school by going to
            Imperial Valley College
            in 2017. As a result, I have been going to school ever since.

        <h3>As a Cancer Survior:</h3>
        <p>
            While attending UCSD in Spring 2021, I started losing weight significantly. I couldn't maintain a healthy
            diet, as I was losing my
            ability to eat. By the Summer of 2021, I was daignosed with <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma">
                Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
            </a>. I was going to pass away and leave my pregnant wife, at the time, and my 1 year old son alone in this
            world. It hurts when I think
            about it, and no level of therapy will truly cause those wounds to heal. Miraculously, I kept advocating for
            myself to doctors to recieved
            chemotherapy treatment. As a result, I was sent to Scripts Mercy Hospital here in San Diego where I managed
            to start therapy and get much needed
            answers. My cancer took over my entire stomach and a mass tumor in the upper cardia of my stomach was
            causing my esophagus to be shut entirley.
            As I was recieving my first chemotherpy, I couldn't help but think <i>I am just so happy to be here to get a
                fighting chance at continuing to be here for my family!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunatley, I beat cancer by Spring 2022. As a result, I am an advocate for Cancer Awareness. One of my
            desires in life is for a cure to cancer to be
            fully found within my lifetime. As a cancer survivor, I can admit that my empathy has grown significantly
            more. I try my hardest to fully understand
            people for who they are and what they stand for! I make sure that every day counts!

                I recently took a programming langauges class! After dealing with lambda calculus and haskell, it really
                makes you miss
                convential programming langauges like <span class="programming-langauges">C</span>, <span
                    class="programming-langauges">C++</span>,
                <span class="programming-langauges">C#</span>, and <span class="programming-langauges">Java</span>!
                Anyways,
                here is one of the functions I made in haskell!
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    assoc :: Int -> String -> [(String, Int)] -> Int
                    -- if the recursive result leads to the empty list, return the default value
                    assoc def key [] = def
                    -- recurse on the tail, while pattern matching on (s, x) which is the head
                    assoc def key ((s,x):xs)
                        -- if the key is the same as the string in the pair, return the pairs value
                        | key == s = x
                        -- else recurse on the tail
                        | otherwise = assoc def key xs
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                this tail recursive function searches the list for the first i such that k<sub>i</sub> is equals to key.
                If such a k<sub>i</sub> is found, then v<sub>i</sub> is returned. Otherwise, if no such k<sub>i</sub>
                exists in the list, `def` is returned. Overall, haskell can be a bit tought to understand.

                In code and in life, a warrior true,<br>
                Balancing bytes and battles, all the way through.<br>
                Through screens of static, and fields of strife,<br>
                A champion in the game of life.<br><br>

                Showing that in life and code, someone deeply cares.<br><br>

                The satisfaction of programs, well-structured and clean,<br>
                A testament to a mind, sharp and keen.<br>
                A victory over cancer, a badge of honor worn,<br>
                In the face of adversity, no man is more sworn.<br><br>

                In Muir Caledonian's ranks, his name resounds,<br>
                Among the learned and the wise, his place abounds.<br>
                An expert infantryman, a veteran brave,<br>
                A legacy of courage, in his heart engraved.<br><br>

                A father, a husband, in life's grand design,<br>
                In the family of code, and the code of family, he does shine.<br>
