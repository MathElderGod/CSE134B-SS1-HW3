                <summary>Journeys Through Computer Science: Compression/Decompression and Encryption/Decription.
                </summary>
                <p>
                    My journey through the vast landscape of Computer Science has led me to delve into intriguing
                    niches, each with its
                    unique set of challenges and rewards. Two of these exciting fields I've been exploring are
                    compression and decompression
                    via <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/binary-tree-serialize-deserialize">Serialization and
                        Deserialization of Binary Trees</a>,
                    and encryption and decryption with SystemVerilog. They might appear quite different at first, but
                    they're bound by the common
                    threads of data transformation and the exploration of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the one hand, I was drawn to the intricate mechanics of serialization and deserialization of
                    Binary Trees during my
                    time at UCSD. This exploration revolved around encoding the structure of a binary tree into a more
                    compact format for
                    efficient storage or transmission - a process known as serialization. To retrieve the original tree,
                    the compressed data
                    would then be decompressed through deserialization. An example is provided in the above image, in
                    which the serialization
                    and deserialization algorithm was run. As you can see, it is not super good with small files,
                    however, the larger the files
                    the greater the compression. As you can see, I managed to compress an 826KB file and turn it into a
                    104KB compressed file.
                    This topic was extremely fascinating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, I've also been intrigued by the magic of encryption and decryption through
                    SystemVerilog. The
                    challenge of operating on a hardware description and verification language level has been both a
                    mind-bending puzzle and
                    a delight. I've learned to craft secure systems through encryption and to unlock encrypted data
                    through decryption. The
                    pinnacle of this part of my journey has been successfully decrypting six polynomial encryptions in
                    parallel - a
                    challenge that tested my limits and expanded my capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While these topics may seem separate, they share a fascinating overlap in the exploration of data
                    manipulation. Both
                    encryption and compression techniques manipulate data in ways that are intended to be reversible.
                    And both have a wide
                    range of applications in areas like data security, storage, and transmission. They show the breadth
                    of what we can
                    achieve with data when we really understand it.
                </p>

                <summary>The Magic of Computer Graphics and My Adventures in Crafting New Realities!</summary>
                <p>
                    My journey in computer science has always been about exploration and growth. One of the most
                    fascinating territories
                    I've ventured into is the realm of Computer Graphics - an area where the theoretical meets the
                    visual, the mathematical
                    intertwines with the artistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the heart of Computer Graphics, we find linear algebra - a subject I have found truly
                    fascinating. It's an abstract
                    field of mathematics that becomes strikingly tangible when applied to graphics. With every vector I
                    manipulate or matrix
                    I transform, I'm essentially shaping pixels to create my own realities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my Computer Graphics course at UCSD, I've had the incredible opportunity to design and
                    develop my own graphical
                    algorithms. I've conjured up Mandelbrot fractals, those stunningly intricate images that capture the
                    essence of
                    mathematical beauty and chaos in a single frame. I've manipulated light via Blinn-Phong's reflection
                    model, bathing my
                    own digitally constructed scenes in various hues and intensities of light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the still, I've ventured into the dynamic, creating camera transformations using the
                    Rodrigues rotation
                    algorithm. This process imbued my digital scenes with a sense of movement and perspective, bringing
                    them to life in ways
                    that static images could never accomplish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've even journeyed along the smooth curves of splines and Bezier curves, implementing De
                    Casteljau's algorithm to
                    render these shapes. To cap it all, I've delved into the intricate process of shadow mapping, adding
                    depth and realism
                    to my graphical creations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With each algorithm implemented and each project completed, I've grown immensely as a computer
                    scientist and as a
                    creator. Each one pushed me to new limits, challenging me to understand complex concepts, apply them
                    effectively, and
                    create something beautiful and functional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This continuous journey into the depths of Computer Graphics has made me appreciate even more how
                    computer science is an
                    incredibly diverse and dynamic field. It's a place where creativity and analytical thinking go hand
                    in hand, creating
                    mesmerizing results. As I continue my journey, I look forward to sharing more of my graphical
                    adventures with you. Please check out my work in projects page! :)

                <summary>Igniting a Revolution: Future Programmers of America and the Need for STEM Outreach!</summary>
                <p>
                    As a dedicated computer scientist and a proud veteran, my passion for service extends beyond the
                    front lines to the
                    minds of the future generation. Today, I wish to highlight a cause dear to my heart â€“ the need for
                    more focused and
                    accessible Computer Science and STEM outreach for underprivileged youth in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    STEM education, particularly Computer Science, is no longer a luxury. It's an essential component of
                    a holistic
                    education in the 21st century. The transformative power of technology is indelible, and to shape a
                    future where everyone
                    has an equitable stake in this revolution, we must ensure our youth have the foundational knowledge
                    to not just
                    participate in, but to shape this digital landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, many children, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds, are yet to receive their
                    invite to this
                    revolution. Limited access to resources, lack of awareness, and a shortage of role models in the
                    field have contributed
                    to this digital divide. It's a chasm that continues to widen with time, and we need a concerted,
                    dedicated effort to
                    bridge this gap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the Future Farmers of America (FFA), an organization that has been pivotal in promoting
                    and supporting
                    agricultural education, I propose the creation of a new initiative â€“ the Future Programmers of
                    America (FPA). The FPA
                    would aim to spark a passion for Computer Science and other STEM fields in the hearts of young
                    learners, particularly
                    those from underrepresented backgrounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By providing access to resources, mentorship, and creating a community that encourages exploration
                    and learning, the FPA
                    could revolutionize how STEM education is approached in our country. We can transform passive
                    consumers of technology
                    into active contributors and creators, instilling not only the skills necessary for future careers
                    but a sense of
                    agency, empowerment, and confidence in our youth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we look forward to the digital future, it's our responsibility to ensure no child is left behind.
                    It is through
                    initiatives like the FPA that we can ignite the flame of curiosity and passion in our youth, paving
                    the way for a
                    generation of innovators, problem solvers, and leaders. This is not merely a dream for a better
                    education system, but a
                    vision for a stronger, more inclusive America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In serving our youth, we are serving our nation. Let's join hands in this noble mission and continue
                    to serve this
                    beautiful country, one line of code at a time.
